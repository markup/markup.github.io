I’ve known this for some time now, yet never got around to writing more than a few notes-to-self in snarky commit messages. It’s time I start sharing.</p>

<p class="callout">So here’s to new beginnings and the will power to follow through.</p>

<p>During 2013, I had the pleasure of working with the good folks at the now-defunct <a href="http://dplusj.com">D+J</a>. While working with them, and because of several communication practices I took part in, I had the opportunity to rediscover the value of writing things down. Its value is two-fold: the writing exercise itself forces us to examine our work and our experience creating it, and the final product leaves a document we (and others) can reference and learn from down the road.</p>

<p>As part of an effort to share my learning process and the principles that guide my work, I’ve decided to share my thoughts and discoveries on matters of design, development, and how these two interact (plus related topics) via this blog. I hope it’s as useful to others as I’m sure it will be to me.</p></section><footer><hr />
